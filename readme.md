# condaJupyterDocker

separate repo to build a docker image that has the conda 3 and jupyter environments installed and some basic volume / port stuff

this should be a full description of the docker image

Note to self: Docker cannot access the GPU of a host machine by default. Check out nvidia docker for more info. Running GPU related code in docker take therefore a bit more time to setup. No plan to invest in this setup now. Will use suitable AMI instead.
